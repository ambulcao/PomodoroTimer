# PomodoroTimer

<p>"The Pomodoro technique, developed in 1988 by the Italian Francisco Cirillo, is a time management method that can be applied to various tasks, whether in studies or at work.</p>

<p>According to Cirillo's book “The Pomodoro Technique”, the technique was created to use time as a valuable ally and accomplish what we want to do and the way we want to do it. In addition, it enables us to continually improve our processes.</p>

<p>By using this method, it is possible to know not only the quantity of activities that are done, but also the quality. In addition, you can measure what is getting in the way of carrying out tasks."</p>
